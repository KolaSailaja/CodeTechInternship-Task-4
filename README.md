## Cloud Security Implementation  

### Objective  
Implement **IAM policies**, **secure storage**, and **data encryption** on a cloud platform.

### Steps Performed  
1. **IAM Policies**  
   - Created roles with least privilege access.  
   - Assigned users specific roles like *Viewer* and *Admin*.  

2. **Secure Storage**
